SAVE YOUR FOOD

## Reduce the Food Wastage and improve the Food Security:

The number of hungry people in the world has increased over the last few years. One in nine people in the world go hungry each day and suffer from nutritional deficiencies as a result. In previous years, food security has been the biggest threat to the overall health of the human population. And 2020 saw the most severe increase in global food insecurity because of the COVID-19 pandemic, impacting vulnerable households everywhere. So, how can you solve this problem with innovation and advancement in Technology.

## Objective

The main objective of our project is to reduce the food wastage and improve food security. We are implementing an admin module who acts as bridge between both the donor and donee module and donor will provide the details of available food and donee will request for the quantity of food required this way admin is able to operate both the donors and donees and makes sure that there is no food wastage and supplies the food to the needy.

A Separate Module With Some Good Features Will be Included In The Module Like Daily Takeaway Scheduling Which Makes Daily Donors Registers For Single Time And The Rest Is Done By Us. We Try To Include Mobile Communication Registering So That They Get More Comfortable For Donating The Overflowed Food

Totally This Project’s Aim Is Of Food Waste Management, We Can’t Force Or Pull People To Stop Wasting Food, But We Could Take That Waste Food & Serve It To The Needy One’s Which Makes In Humanity Spreads With The Use Of Technology. Similar To The Donor Communication Module Feature, The Same Feature Would Be Added To The Donee Module Too.
